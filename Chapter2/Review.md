# 1. What is the purpose of the "Hello, World!" program?
The purpose of this program is to get acquainted with the syntax, development environment, and compilation procedure when learning a new programming language. 

# 2. Name the four parts of a function.
According to our text the four parts of a function are:
+ A _return_ _type_ (what kind of result to return int,string,etc.)
+ A _name_
+ A _parameter_ list enclosed in parentheses. 
+ A _function_ _body_ enclosed in a set of curly braces.

# 3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.
Every C++ program must contain the function main(), it is used to tell the computer where to begin execution.

# 4. In the "Hello,World!" program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?
This line is used to determine if the program ran successfully, or not. If main returns 0 then we were successful.

# 5. What is the purpose of a compiler?
A compiler is used to convert source code (human-readable code) into object (machine) code, which can be read by the computer.

# 6. What is the purpose of the \#include directive?
It instructs the computer to make available the facilities from the file "std\_lib\_facilities.h". I imagine it has the same fuctionality as library()/require() in R, import in python in \usepackage{} in LaTeX.

# 7 . What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?
.h is just an alternative to the .cpp file extension indicating it is a C++ program.

# 8. What does the linker do for your program?
The linker connects the object code returned from the compiler with the functionality of the C++ standard library to create an executable program.

# 9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
A source file is the human-readable version of the code which is converted (by the compiler) into an object file, which is then linked with the C++ standard library to create an executable file.

# 10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
An interactive development environment (IDE), allows you more easily create programs? It often has shortcuts accessed through tab completion, and features for error handling.

# 11. If you understand everything in this textbook, why is it necessary to practice?
If one does not practice a langugae then they might end up forgetting important details about, thus becoming less fluent. Additionally it is important in programming to practice what is taught in the textbook so one can write usable programs, not just some theoretical "toy" program.
