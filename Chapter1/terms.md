# Terms associated with chapter 1
This document contains a list of keywords that the author has suggested we define each term and its relevance to cmoputer science and programming. Through defining these terms we will be better equipped to articulate ideas related to the programming field.

**Affordability**: When creating software for a client, we must ensure that it is within their price range. I assume that this creates a tradeoff in the sophistication of the features and even the features that are included (no frills added if on a tight budget). Secondly I believe it is important to consider not only the cost of creating a software, but also to cost of maintenance. 

**Analysis**: This is listed in our book as one of the four stages of program development. When developing a program it is important we analyze the problem we are trying to solve to answer a few questions that will help us determine what direction to move forward in. 
These questions include: 
+ what's the problem? 
+ What does the user want? 
+ What does the user need? (There is an important distinction between this and the last question)
+ What can the user afford?
+ What kind of reliability do we need? (I am unsure of what reliability is meant in this context; hopefully as I continue to learn more it is made clear)

**Blackboard**: Feedback is considered one of the most important steps in the design phase, and one easy way to receive feedback is by writing yourself (or others). By writing down your ideas/design on a blackboard(whiteboard) it allows you to collect your thoughts and flesh out what you plan to do. The book recommends that you don't start coding before you have have tried explaining your ideas to someone (maybe a rubber ducky).

**CAD/CAM**: CAD and CAM stand for computer aided design, and computer aided manufacturing respectively. 

**Communication**: Being able to interact with others on a technically diverse team, and explain technical concepts to non-techincal audiences is arguably important in every discipline. This is especially true for programming as you'll want to be able to justify certain techniques. You may think that you have the best solution, but someone else on your team could have a more elegant & effective solution (check your ego at the door, be open to others ideas).

**Correctness**: At the end of the day it's important that your program/software solves the problem you were tasked with, and that it's correct! If it's not, I imagine there could be serious repercussions.

**Customer**: Who you want to make happy :grin:

**Design**: Another stage of program development. This stage is interested in the following questions:
+ How do we solve the problem?
+ What should be the overall structure of the system?
+ Which parts does it consist of?
+ How do those parts communicate with each other?
+ How does the system communicate with its users?

**Feedback**: As mentioned above in "Blackboard," it's important to receive feedback when designing your program.

**GUI**: Graphical user interface. I guess this is anything that isn't strictly command line?

**Ideals**: 
+ _correctness_
+ _reliability_
+ _well designed_
+ _affordable_
+ _maintainable_

**Implementation**: A combination of the programming and testing stages of program development.

**Programmer**: A person who programs.

**Programming**: One of the fours stages of program development. The book defines programming as expressing the solution in code, writing the code such that it meets all constraints (time, money, space, reliability,...). Make sure it's correct and maintainable.

**Software**: The book defines _software_ as a collection of programs running on some computer. It's invisible!

**Stereotype**: Many have come to consider programmers to be introverted, socially outcast, nerds; milder versions of these people exist within the community (according to the book), but the field is probably as diverse as other fields of work.

**Testing**: One of the four stages of program development. "This is where you make sure the system works correctly under all circumstances required by systematically trying it out."

**User**: In the world of TRON... not a program.
