# Do you think computers will ever develop to be conscious, thinking beings, capable of competing with humans? Write a short paragraph supporting your position.

Although great strides have been made in the aritifical intelligence community, as evidenced through image recognition, I do not think computers will ever develop their own consciousness. This is because computers are inherently dumb, we have to tell them what to do typically in the form of code. This doesn't mean the current state of AI can't be improved, I think we'll see computers become better at predicting certain things, and will have more human-like conversations with their users through voice assitants such as siri, cortana, and alexa. This will only be an illusion though; someone will have created an algorithm/model that can predict the best way to respond to an individual, and probably throw a little bit of randomness in their because no one is perfect.
