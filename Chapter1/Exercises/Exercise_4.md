# Describe an activity that would not have been possible without computers.

I believe that indoor skydiving would truly be impossible if it were not for computers. The information generated from having customers pay and (presumably) signing a waiver is likely stored in a databse, which must use computers. Additionally I imagine that the operator of the wind tunnel can control different aspects of the "flight," such as wind speed, so this would require some computer interface.
