# Make a list of ten activities that people do that do not involve computers in any way, even indirectly.

1. Running (assuming you don't listen to music or track your runs)
2. Painting
3. Singing 
4. Dancing
5. Playing a musical instrument (without the use of electronic tuners/metronomes, tuning forks only!)
6. Sleeping!
7. Rock Climbing (not using any equipment created by computers)
8. Thinking
9. Primitive Camping
10. Swimming in the ocean

This was a rather difficult exercise, and you could argue any of the above can involve the use of computers (as noted by some caveats).
