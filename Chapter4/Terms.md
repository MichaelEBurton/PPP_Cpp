**abstraction**: A technique for breaking up big computations into many little ones. Abstraction works by hiding details we don't need to use a facility behind a convienent and general interface.

**computation**: Producing an output given some inputs (and instructions)

**conditional statement**: A statement containing code that should only be executed if a specified condition is met.

**declaration**: A statement that gives a name to an object.

**definition**: A declaration that sets aside memory for an object.

**divide and conquer**: A technique for breaking up big computations into many little ones. We take a large problem and divide it into several little ones.

**else**: Statement executed if the preceding if-statement coniditons were not met.

**expression**: Computes a value from a number of operands.

**for-statement**:  A statement used to iterate over a sequence of numbers; the management of the control variable is concentrated at the top of the loop.

**range-for-statement**:Read for control variable in vector. Used to traverse a vector.

**function**: A computation with a name.

**if-statement**: Code executed only if a specified condition is met. 

**increment**: Increase the value.

**input**: Arguments going into a function.

**iteration**: A single execution of block of code.

**loop**: A block of code that is executed multiple times.

**lvalue**: A name referring to a box where an object is stored.

**member function**: A function declared in the scope of a class.

**output**: What is returned by a function/program.

**push_back()**: Method to add an element to a vector.

**repitition**: A repeat of some code.

**rvalue**: Right-hand value.

**selection**: A statment used to select what code to run (if or switch)

**size()**: Used to access the size of a vector.

**sort()**: Sorts a vector.

**statement**: Used to produce several values, do something many times, and choose among alternatives.

**switch-statement**: Used when comparing a variable to a list of constants.

**vector**: A sequence of elements you can access by an index.

**while-statement**: A loop that runs for a while...ba dum tss.
