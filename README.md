# Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++
This repository's purpose is to host my notes from Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++" textbook. I am not intending this repository to be helpful to others, so the structure may only suit my needs.

In each folder labeled by the chapter name you can find the following:
+ Attempt of Review Questions
+ Attempt of Drills
+ Terms and their meaning
+ Exercise Attempts

Although I have programmed in Java, Python, R, and SAS before, my programming has been statistical in nature and I have not spent as much time exploring the theory behind programming. By going through this text I hope to cement my understanding of programming fundamentals that I can use in my future career. I settled on this book because I was interested in learning through c++ (no particular reason), and why not learn from the man who invented the language? 

## Resources & General Notes

+ For compiling C++ on my windows machine I have chosen the MINGW compiler
+ For compiling C++ on my linux machine I have yet to choose a compiler


```
# How to compile on windows

g++ file.cpp -o file.exe

# How to execute file in git bash

./file.exe
```

```
\\ This is how you comment in C++

\\ In order to use the standard library facilities header you must include the following line in your header


#include "../../../std_lib_facilities.h" \\ path to file

```
