**analysis**: The stage of software development where you figure out what needs to be done and then write a description of these specifications.

**class**: A class is a user-defined type.

**class member**: 	A type, variable, constant, or function declared in the scope of a class.

**data member**: Member of a class that can hold a value.

**design**: One stage of software development where you create an overall structure for the system, deciding which parts the system should have, and how they communicate.

**divide by zero**: An error thrown when trying to divide one number by zero (which is mathematically impossible)

**grammar**: A grammar defines the syntax of user input.

**implementation**: One stage of software development; the stage where you write the code, debug it, and test that it actually does what it is supposed to.

**interface**: a set of declarations that defines how a part of a program can be accessed.

**member function**: A function declared in the scope of a class.

**parser**: A program that reads a stream of tokens according to a grammar.

**private**: a member accessible only from its own class. Usually used to hide the details of a member function not needed for a user to view.

**prototype**: An initial version of a program.

**pseudo code**: Written 'scribbles' of what your program intends to do. It roughly follows the logic of 'real' code.

**public**: a member accessible to all users of a class.

**syntax analyzer**: A parser; reads a stream of tokens analyzing them according to a grammar.

**token**: A sequence of characters that represent something we consider a unit.

**use case**: A sketch of how we expect a user to use our program. (what we output, what they enter...)
