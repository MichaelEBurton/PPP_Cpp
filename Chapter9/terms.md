**built-in types**: A type is built-in if the compiler knows how to represent objects of the type and which operations can be done on it without being told by declrations supplied by a programmer in source code.

**class**: A user-defined type.

**const**: The const keyword (in the context of this chapter) lets the program know that something is constant, and in the case of a function it is non-modifying.

**constructor**: A member function with the same name as its class that is used for initialization of objects of the class.

**destructor**: Gets rid of a class object.

**enum**: A simple user-defined type, specifying its set of values as symbolic constants.

**enumeration**: A complete set of values in a listing.

**enumerator**: A value in an enumeration.

**helper function**: A function that can be simply, elegantly, and efficiently implemented as a freestanding function.

**implementation**: Part of the class declaration that its users access indirectly through the interface.

**in-class initializer**: A constructor?

**inlining**: Putting a member function defintion in the class body. This can be useful for optimization when the function is really small. Not useful for big functions.

**interface**: Part of the class the users access directly.

**invariant**: a rule for what constitutes a valid value.

**representation**: A type knows how to represent the data needed in an object.

**struct**: A simple class that consists only of data.

**structure**: A data structure.

**user-defined type**: A class defined by the user.

**valid state**: When the value of an object is valid.
